Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole and optionally a DHCP server, intended for use on a private network. It is designed for low-power embedded devices with network capability, such as the Raspberry Pi, but can be installed on almost any Linux machine.

Pi-hole has the ability to block traditional website advertisements as well as advertisements in unconventional places, such as smart TVs and mobile operating system advertisements.

 Imager will prompt you to apply OS customization in a popup. Setting up your Raspberry Pi through the OS customization settings is highly advised. To access the OS customization, click the Edit Settings icon.

Should you choose not to customize your Raspberry Pi through the OS customization options, Raspberry Pi OS will prompt you for the same data during the configuration wizard's initial boot. If you would like to forego OS customization, choose the No box.
